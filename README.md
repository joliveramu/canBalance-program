# canBalance-program
This is not a project but a program that I encountered in my internship interview. 
One of its objective is to see if a certain Integer array is balanced or not.

# What I did?
One thing I noticed is its sequence. for example, I have this integer array of 1,2,3,4, and 5. If we add them all we will get a sum of 15 (1+2+3+4+5). Now, to say that this array is balanced, I noticed as well that if it is divisible by two, it is balanced. So, this is a blow-out for the program. Case closed. hehe 

# Tips And Tricks that made it done
-Create a variable that will hold the sum of the array as it loops on its element
-Create a decision that if the given array in the canBalance function is balanced or not. Like this, 

if total % 2 == 0:
  print("Balanced")
else:
  print("Not Balanced")
  
It's done. I hope I passed with that but I believe I freaking will! hehehe 

Happy Coding!
